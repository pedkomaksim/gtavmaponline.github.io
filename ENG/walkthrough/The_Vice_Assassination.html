<p><strong class="selflink">The Vice Assassination</strong> is the third assassination mission given to Franklin by Lester and represents an opportunity for enormous investment return in the Stock Market for Fruit and Facade. It is wise to defer this Mission, as well as all other Assassination Missions, as late in the main game as possible to maximize available venture capital.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="MISSION_NOTE:_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITY.21"> MISSION NOTE: INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!<br /> </span></h3>
<p>Before pursuing this mission, switch to all three characters and invest all your cash in Fruit (FRT) shares on the BAWSAQ.

<p>When the mission begins, get in your vehicle and drive over to the waypoint near the garages in Davis. When you arrive, you'll overhear the working girl mention that she's waiting for her customer.

<p>Drive over the adjacent hill and wait across from where the working girls is standing with a Sniper Rifle in hand. Observe the girl as she rejects several customers that drive by her (two cars, to be exact).

<p>The THIRD car that arrives in the drop top will be the one to pick her up, so quickly aim your Sniper Rifle and shoot the driver in the head.

<p>Quickly hightail it out of the area to complete the mission for an easy Gold. 
</p><p>From this point, you'll need to wait 2-3 in-game days for the Fruit stocks to reach 50% before selling (<i>on PS4/X1 consoles, the Fruit stock will only go as high as 25%</i>). Once you get near 50%, SELL all your shares and then invest everything in Facade (FAC). Give it about 3-4 in-game days to reach 33% and then SELL your shares for big profit!
