<p>The fastest and easiest approach would be to simply drive into the lot, quickly steal the truck with the Driller and drive off with it. Losing the heat will take some clever work but it can be done! But if you're aiming for the Gold, it won't be as simple as just breaking inside.

<p>In order to achieve the Gold, you'll need to sneak into the lot and take the truck without getting detected or incurring any Police attention. Read the walkthrough below for the juicy details on getting the easy Gold.
</p>
</div>
<p>First thing you'll need are TWO weapons: the Sniper Rifle and the HEAVY Rifle. When you get to the area, climb to the rooftop on the SOUTH side of the lot.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/8/8e/GTAV.PS4.1080P.933.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.933.jpg"></span></span>
<p>From this vantage point, you'll be able to see most of the workers and the security guards. Stay in position and you'll notice one of the workers will walk away from his default position and take a smoke break near the security guard. You <b>MUST</b> wait for this guy to take a smoke break! Also, you'll notice two chatty co-workers standing next to a shack. Leave those two for LAST!
</p><p>When that worker takes his smoke break, everyone will be in prime position so equip the Sniper Rifle and target each person from the RIGHT side all the way to the LEFT (you're sniping each person in counter-clockwise order).
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/2/2a/GTAV.PS4.1080P.935.jpg/228px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.935.jpg"></span></span> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/8/86/GTAV.PS4.1080P.934.jpg/228px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.934.jpg"></span></span>
<p>Start by sniping the security guy on the right side. Then move left to the smoke break guy and take a shot.
</p>

<p>Next, move to the left and snipe the worker that's welding on something (located to the left of the Driller). Then move further left and snipe the worker that's furthest away.
</p>

<p>For the next two, you'll need to move further back to see the other security guard on the western side. Snipe the security guard by the western entrance and then move left and snipe the lone guy standing by the other shack.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/0/09/GTAV.PS4.1080P.940.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.940.jpg"></span></span>
<p>This leaves the last two guys who are just chatting away next to an office shack. If you try to snipe them one-by-one, it WILL cause you to lose the Gold since the other one will get alerted. Do NOT attempt to get near them and avoid using stealth on them!
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/5/53/GTAV.PS4.1080P.941.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.941.jpg"></span></span>
<p>To eliminate both guys in one fell swoop, you'll need the <b>Heavy Rifle</b>. Jump down towards the exit on the east side (the right side with the security guard) so that you stay undetected and equip the Heavy Rifle. Line up both guys in your crosshairs and go for the shot. If done correctly, you'll snag both men with just one bullet!
</p>

<p>Yay! If you followed the walkthrough above, you should be able to eliminate all the workers and security guards without alerting any Police. From there, steal the truck and drive it to the designated lot to complete the mission.
