<p>You now have the perfect opportunity to make some extra money in the Stock Market! Before pursuing this mission, be sure to invest all your money in buying stock with Debonaire (DEB) on the LCN Exchange page. Do this for all three characters! Once all the stock is bought, start the mission.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="TARGET_.231:_BODYBUILDER"> TARGET #1: BODYBUILDER<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/5/50/GTAV.PS4.1080P.351.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.351.jpg"></span></span>
<p>The first target is over at Vespucci Beach flexing his muscles. Avoid getting near the target and use the nearby rooftops in the parking lot to get a good vantage point.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/b/b5/GTAV.PS4.1080P.352.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.352.jpg"></span></span>
<p>Zoom in on the guy flexing and immediately shoot him down. No headshots are necessary, so just shoot and get moving to the next one.
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="TARGET_.232:_MAN_ON_YACHT"> TARGET #2: MAN ON YACHT<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/e/e3/GTAV.PS4.1080P.353.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.353.jpg"></span></span>
<p>The second target is relaxing on his yacht over by Pacific Bluffs. When you arrive at the parking lot near the target, you can either snipe him from within shoreline distance or use the nearby Jetski.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/a/a9/GTAV.PS4.1080P.354.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.354.jpg"></span></span>
<p>For faster results, snipe the target as he gets within your target reticle. Again, no headshots are necessary!
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="TARGET_.233:_WINDOW_CLEANER"> TARGET #3: WINDOW CLEANER<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/2/25/GTAV.PS4.1080P.357.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.357.jpg"></span></span>
<p>The third target is over by Rockford Hills washing windows at an office building. Get within distance of the target by staying on the sidewalk for a good vantage point.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/3/3f/GTAV.PS4.1080P.355.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.355.jpg"></span></span>
<p>You'll have to be quick since the target is using the pulley to raise himself higher. Snipe him from behind to reveal the last target.
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="TARGET_.234:_VESPA_GUY"> TARGET #4: VESPA GUY<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/a/a5/GTAV.PS4.1080P.356.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.356.jpg"></span></span>
<p>The fourth target is located high above the Vinewood Hills area. Fortunately, the target doesn't start riding his Vespa until you get close, so drive up to his location to find him.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/d/d3/GTAV.PS4.1080P.358.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.358.jpg"></span></span>
<p>Either ram him over and then shoot him down or use Drive-bys. Once the target is gone, Franklin will give Lester a call and the mission is complete!

<p>After completing the mission, go back to your Save House and advance the time by 8 hours by taking naps (no need to Save). Check your portfolio page and wait for the DEB Percentage to increase by at least 80%. If you get within 75% or closer, it's still good enough, so immediately SELL all your assets to get a good profit for all the characters.
</p><p>Once you've sold your shares to Debonaire, immediately invest all your money in Redwood Cigarettes (RWC) shares. From there, you need to give the Redwood stock at least FIVE in-game days to increase in Percentage. Take multiple naps and checking back on your portfolio just in case. By the fifth day, the percentage should increase to about 322% (anything above 300% is golden).
</p><p>With the high percentage on RWC above 300%, immediately SELL your assets to receive several millions of dollars in profit! CHA-CHING!!!
