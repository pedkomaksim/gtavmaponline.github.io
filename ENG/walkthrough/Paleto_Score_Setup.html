<p>To trigger this mission, drive over to the meth lab and go upstairs. After the cutscene, go downstairs and enter Michael's car with Trevor.

<p>The best and fastest way to get to Paleto Bay in less than 3:30 is to have Michael's car modded BEFORE you do this mission. If you were unable to mod Mike's car before doing the Caida Libre mission, then you'll have to drive to Paleto without any interruptions.
</p><p>Another way to mod Michael's car for this mission is after you finish the mission, switch to Michael. He'll be with his car. Take the car to the nearest LS Customs and get it modded, then Autosave over your main savegame. Then, replay this mission. When you leave the meth lab to get in Michael's car, it will be sitting out front with the mods intact.
</p><p>To avoid confusion, understand that the Gold Requirement to drive "to the bank" within 3:30 is misleading. The yellow Destination Marker is actually the bus stop where you meet Lester in Paleto Bay. (You don't drive to the bank until after you've picked Lester up. The trip from the bus stop to the bank&nbsp;isn't included in the Gold Requirement time limit of 3:30).

<p>Once you arrive at Paleto Bay, drive to the waypoint to trigger a cutscene with Lester. From there, drive to the bank and take a look at the front door.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/4/4d/GTAV.PS4.1080P.660.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.660.jpg"></span></span>
<p>After casing the front of the bank, drive towards the side of the bank in the grassy area. When prompted, bust out a weapon and shoot the alarm (the white-colored one) and then get back in the car and wait at the nearby gas station (park the car in the OPPOSITE direction).
</p>

<p>After a minute or so, the Police arrive and Trevor gets spooked and runs out of the car and onto a motorcycle.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/f/fb/GTAV.PS4.1080P.662.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.662.jpg"></span></span>
<p>From here, you need to drive back to the meth lab by either using Michael in his car or switching to Trevor and his motorcycle. The path going up the mountain can be tricky with all it's twist and turns but you should be able to cut off Trevor (or vice versa) while driving up the terrain.

<p>If Mike has a Modded car, he should be able to win the race against Trevor. But if the car is un-modded then you'll need to drive super carefully to avoid Trevor from overtaking you. Otherwise, switch to Trevor and zoom over to the meth lab to win the race.

<p>Once you get back to the meth lab, Lester sets up the score. Choose an additional gunman for the job (a good choice would be Packie or Chef) and the mission is complete.
