<p>Through most of the game, Chop lives at Franklin's second house in the hills. He is also occasionally available when switching to Franklin from another character.
</p><p><b><a href="#Chop_in_the_iFruit_App">You can even teach Chop some new tricks!</a></b>
</p><p>Chop will hop into the passenger seat of any Vehicle Franklin is driving and follow him in and out of the car. He will attack any character who assaults Franklin and can easily disable or kill an armed opponent.
</p><p>In the Story Mission entitled "Chop", you briefly gain the ability to see through Chop's eyes. This ability does not translate to later Missions.
</p><p>You can play catch with Chop by throwing a baseball as Franklin. Playing with <strong class="selflink">Chop</strong> is a prerequisite for 100% Completion.
</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Chop can be taught to search out Collectibles via the IFruit app for iOS.

<p>The companion app, IFruit, has a Chop care minigame. In this game you can earn points while feeding Chop to make him happy. This, in turn, will make Chop more effective in GTA 5. He will also stop doing 'his business' in Franklin's house.
