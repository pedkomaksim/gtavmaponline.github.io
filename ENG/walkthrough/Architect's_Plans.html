<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="MISSION_NOTE:_WHERE.27S_THE_MISSION.3F"> MISSION NOTE: WHERE'S THE MISSION?<br /> </span></h3>
<p>This mission will not appear on the map! To trigger it, you must switch to Michael and complete another mission. Once that's done, Franklin sends a text saying he's found the architect. From there, switch to Franklin to automatically trigger the mission.
</p>

<p>When you enter the construction site, a worker near the entrance will pass you a hard hat.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/e/e5/GTAV.PS4.1080P.826.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.826.jpg"></span></span>
<p>The architect will be walking the premises, so begin tailing him. There are two ways to get the blueprints from the architect: the Easy Way or the Hard Way.
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="THE_HARD_WAY"> THE HARD WAY<br /> </span></h2>
<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/5/50/053a.jpg/468px-053a.jpg"></span></span>
<p>When the mission begins, follow the architect down the path. Keep a distance and follow him up towards the elevators while avoiding detection from the other workers. Enter the next elevator and take it to the top floor.
</p>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/5/59/053b.jpg/468px-053b.jpg"></span></span>
<p>When the architect exits, do NOT follow him past the other two workers that he talks to! If you walk past them, they will chase after you!
</p><p>Instead, make a right turn from when you exit the elevator to the other side of the floor. From there, the architect will walk towards you.
</p><p>If you assault the architect, Franklin will receive a 2-Star Wanted level! To avoid all of that drama, avoid hitting the architect and pull out a weapon instead. Approach the guy from behind and aim the gun at his back to make him drop the briefcase (do NOT shoot him). By doing this, you won't get pegged with 2 stars.
</p><p>When he drops the briefcase, take it from him and then take the elevator back down to ground level and quickly exit the premises for the Gold.
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="THE_EASY_WAY"> THE EASY WAY<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/0/0b/GTAV.PS4.1080P.827.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.827.jpg"></span></span>
<p>To avoid taking the elevator, immediately approach the architect and assault him or stun him with the Stun Gun. Assaulting the architect will nab a 2-star Wanted level while using a weapon will nab you a 3-Star Wanted level. Take the briefcase and run for the exit!

 <p>The timer starts once Franklin takes the briefcase, so get out of the construction zone as fast as possible!
</p>
</div>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/6/64/GTAV.PS4.1080P.830.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.830.jpg"></span></span>
<p>Clear your Wanted level and then get in your vehicle and drive back to the garment factory to complete the mission.
</p> 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="PLANNING_THE_HEIST"> PLANNING THE HEIST<br /> </span></h2>
&nbsp;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-5/thumb/c/c2/GTAV.PS4.1080P.831.jpg/468px-GTAV.PS4.1080P.831.jpg"></span></span>
<p>Once you bring the briefcase to the garment factory, you'll have to choose one of the two ways to do the Heist. Lester will map out the details in two forms:
</p><p>FIRETRUCK APPROACH
</p>
<ul><li>Getaway Vehicle
</li><li>Firetruck
</li><li>Two Gunmen
</li></ul>
<p>ROOFTOP APPROACH
</p>
<ul><li>One Hacker, one Gunman, and One Driver
</li></ul>

<p>The Firetruck approach requires extra work and is not as heavy on the gunplay while the Rooftop approach is a much shorter mission but heavy on the bloodshed.
</p><p>Also note that using Rooftop approach will increase your Crew's stats by 25% versus the Firetruck approach. Pick wisely!
