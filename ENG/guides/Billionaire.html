							Before you go and read through this massive guide, please make sure you keep these points in mind.<br>
<br>
<b>Update Note: If you have enough patience and are completely determined to get the most out of this guide, you may want to read the guide thoroughly BEFORE you start your Assassination Missions! These will help you truly reach the stage of a "Billionaire"</b><br>
<br>
1. The pictures of Stock Markets were taken after doing this so you may get different results on that market when you look at it. This was purely just to set an example.<br>
<br>
2. This guide does not use any cheats, glitches or mods. This is completely programmed by Rockstar to work this out.<br>
<br>
3. This guide has been made by someone with quite a bit of experience in doing this so I will be able to answer the majority of your questions.<br>
<br>
4. If you get a COMPLETELY different result than you should have, you have done something wrong or maybe misread the guide. Don't beat yourself up over this.<br>
<br>
5. The BAWSAQ Stock Market has completely different results every time. Bare in mind, reloading a save may cause you to get a different result every time.<br>
<br>
6. Make sure you're profiting at ALL TIMES. If not, you may have read the statistics wrong.<br>
<br>
7. Don't forget to read the Introduction section. You HAVE TO read this first before anything else!<br>
<br>
8. If there is anything you need help with, regarding this topic, please let me know by posting a comment.<br>
<br>
9. The Vice Assassination can be really unpredictable at times but don't worry if you can't get the sales high enough. I sometimes get the same problem. After all, it is on BAWSAQ.<br>
<br>
10. Before starting any missions, please read the comments. There are always some rumours of different methods that you may want to try out. These may not always work as sometimes it may just be the user's luck or a coincidence. If the method does work, please confirm it in the comments so I can make this guide even better for others. There are also other errors that I might have made that you may want to check the comments for too. Please read Point 11 before reading the comments.<br>
<br>
11. Please be aware that some people in the comments have mentioned things that would be classed as spoilers. Read the comments at your own risk!<br>
<br>
12. Please refer to the Questions and Answers section before you ask a question just in case it's already been answered!<br>
<br>
13. All comments unrelated to this guide or Grand Theft Auto V as a whole will be deleted. Continue to do it and I will not allow you to post related things to this guide either.<br>
<br>
14. Ignore unrelated comments at all times. I will be sure to deal with them within 24 hours. Thankfully you've all ignored the previous user who decided to fill the comments with unrelated topics.<br>
<br>
15. Be sure to check out the "How to Get the Most Money in Heists!" section of this guide to maximize your results on this guide. It is not crucial however, it will only help you gain EVEN MORE money.<br>
<br>
These are all of the points you will need to keep in mind so far. This guide may be updated regularly and this may change from time to time.							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Introduction													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
I'm making this guide, purely for new players to Grand Theft Auto V, looking to get a huge amount of cash. Make sure you don't do ANY Lester Assassination Missions before this guide! This may require you to load up old saves, or even start an entirely new game. Don't worry though, if you truely are desperate to collect this amount of cash, you won't mind doing so. <br>
<br>
This guide also requires a lot of paitence too so be very aware about that. All of the 'BAWSAQ' stock market puchases WILL ALWAYS vary. However, 'LCN' will NOT vary. LCN is very much the same. This should not make much effect on you though, it didn't really bother me too much.<br>
<br>
Don't forget that you may need to keep coming back to this guide, so if you would like to, you can give it a favourite or maybe share it just so you can find it easier (I'm not begging for favourites, otherwise I would have told you to leave a like as well). If you have anything you would like to ask, leave a comment down below and I will check it and reply within 24 hours (hopefull).<br>
<br>
Also, if you get the time, it would be nice if you could share your results on different missions (what percentage you got etc) in the comments for others to check as well. If anyone gets higher or lower percentages that people haven't mentioned or isn't in this guide, leave a comment too and I will update it. (I will most likely know if you're telling lies, I have done this over 4 times now).<br>
<br>
Thank you and good luck!<br>
<br>
PS<br>
There is a random event that helps you get some extra millions that you may want to avoid until the end of this guide. The location of this event will be marked in a screenshot below in this section of the guide.<br>

							Questions and Answers													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							<u><b>I've come across some questions that have either been asked frequently or that I feel should be shown hear with an answer. So I made a Q&amp;A section for this guide to maybe help those of you who haven't visited yet.</b></u><br>
<br>
<b>I've completed all of the Assassination missions for Story Mode. Is there another way I can earn money?</b><br>
<i>The answer is no. Your best bet is an old save or if not, restarting Story Mode is the only option. The Stock Markets are incredibly unpredictable and if you want to try to get lucky on them without the Assassination missions, you're going to still be there on the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</i><br>
<br>
<b>I'm losing profit on my investement! Am I doing something wrong?</b><br>
<i>Yes or no. If you've saved when you have started seeing a decrease, yes. Otherwise no. You can just reload your save and sell your market shares when it's at its highest.</i><br>
<br>
<b>I did the first assassination (Assassination 1: The Hotel Assassination) before I did the other missions. Should I do the other assassination missions before I continue with the story missions?</b><br>
<i>No. As I said, the first assassination isn't really crucial and it has to be completed before the end of Story Mode. However the rest of the Assassination Missions must be left until the end of Story Mode.</i><br>
<br>
<b>The Tinkle Random Event isn't appearing! What should I do?</b><br>
<i>This has been brought up a couple of times before. Be patient and give it time. I was able to make him appear straight away from heading towards Los Santos on the highway on a Monday afternoon. There is no reason to why he shouldn't spawn unless you have already accidently done that mission.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Is there anyway to not sit there for hours clicking the + button to invest?</b><br>
<i>This may seem dumb to some people but it's a common mistake. You can make it rise faster by simply holding down left click on the + button.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Why should you start the those Assassination Missions on a Monday or Tuesday?</b><br>
<i>On Monday's or Tuesday's it shoots up the highest and the quickest.</i>							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Different Ways of Passing Time													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							I made this section as there are lots of ways to pass time in Grand Theft Auto V so I felt the need to explain the ones I know. These have ALL been recorded with a rounded up time. This means that these will not be SPOT ON, although they will be very, very, VERY close to it. I hope this section helps some of you who want to do other stuff than just go to sleep.<br>
<br>
Please note that I have never tried anything other than sleeping to pass time on purpose so I guess you could say at the moment, sleeping is the only reliable access to passing time without over shooting your investments. I might add some personalised things you can do while you're passing time. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
SLEEPING<br>
<br>
Clearly, this is the MOST obvious one to passing time and possible the easiest. This is however, the most boring one there is. This is the most reliable one so far as it‚„ just the right amount of time and you‚‚e unlikely to overshoot it. I have recently been notified of each character has its own unique sleeping time.<br>
<br>
<b>Micheal De Santa</b><br>
Hours Passed: 6 hours<br>
<br>
<b>Franklin Clinton</b><br>
Hours Passed: 8 hours<br>
<br>
<b>Trevor Phillips</b><br>
Hours Passed: 12 hours<br>
<br>
I usually use Franklin because that seems to be the best. It doesn't take as long as Micheal but it doesn't overshoot a lot like Trevor.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703352&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721590844/B8EB2B78E2427C70FB6E8ACF3B1866DABA6145BB/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
FREE ROAM<br>
<br>
So there are many people who just like to mess about it free roam now and then. If you are one of those people, maybe you should try some of the ‚Ñhings to do‚û These may give you something to do while you wait for time to slowly go by. This is the longest way of doing it but if you keep checking every in game hour, you will never over shoot it. This doesn‚‰ mean you shouldn‚‰ still save anymore.<br>
Hours Passed: Normal time: 1 Minute = 1.5 Seconds<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=426454960&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357714712688/826CC0A38EA248AD33DAFF3DE9A76079136C7114/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
TAXI RIDES<br>
<br>
I doubt many people do this but this can be for people who are worried about over shooting it and waiting forever to get back there again. This isn‚‰ a very reliable time, I‚Êe yet to test it a bit more.<br>
Hours Passed: 1-4<br>
<br>
HOSPITAL VISITS<br>
<br>
Dying probably isn‚‰ the greatest of things to do, maybe even something you might want to avoid in cases like these. This can easily over shoot your investment and you will feel gutted if it wasn‚‰ intentional. You will also loose some of your cash in the process. The most amount of cash they can take from your account is $5000.<br>
Hours Passed: 10<br>
<br>
More ways to pass time will be here soon.							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Passing Time in Normal Free Roam													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							This section will give you ideas on what to do while passing time on free roam without skipping a minute and having a bit of fun. This is mainly for those who want to just have fun while becoming billionaires. You can tuck straight into this, they may look boring but it's amazing what some people will find themselves doing when they are trying to have fun so I will also mention the possibilities of doing these things.<br>

<b>Random Beach Balls</b><br>
<br>

Possibilities - As stupid as this looks, you will first off be using time driving to the location which is a bonus I guess. However, you could try many things with these beach balls. Shoot them, see what happens. Push them into the water, watch the results. Drive into them, what happened? Maybe nothing will happen. Who knows? Either way, it's a little something to have a look at.<br>
To refresh them (respawn the beach balls), drive just past the tennis court on the highway and turn back. Screenshots below to help.<br>

<br>
Possibilities - The rampage missions are quick, simple and easy in a fun way. This will help you pass time by making you travel from mission to mission and holding off different gangs, rednecks and more while in rage mode. And who doesn't like it when Trevor gets angry?<br>

<b>Police Chase</b><br>
<br>
There is no location or appearance for this one because it can be in any location and look different every time. Is all you do is wait until you hear sirens and try to find where it's coming from. Once you have found the police car, follow it and see what happens. If it is chasing someone, it usually ends up in a gun fight between two or more people.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you want to, you can even join in and choose your side in it. But remember, shooting either people will get yourself into a police chase which could lead to death. If I was you, just sit back and watch the show.<br>

This has been suggested many times before and I feel like it's crucial to earning that extra bit of money BEFORE doing the Assassination missions. $2,100,000 may not seem like an aweful lot to you, but trust me, it makes a hell of a difference when it comes to the end results of the Assassination missions.<br>
<br>
First off, you will want to go through the Epsilon Program missions. Yes, I know, if you've already done this you will understand the struggles with coping with this mission. As I've stated before though, this IS an optional mission.<br>

Can't find it? To save you a quick trip to Google or YouTube, here's the location to kick off the whole set of side-missions in just one screenshot.<br>

Once there, you must now "enjoy" the whole story line of the dreaded "Epsilon Program" and probably regret doing it for the very small result, especially if you accidently choose to respect the Epsilon Program by not being greedy and taking the irresistible 2.1 million stored in the boot of your car. Do EVERY mission ANY WAY you want up until the final mission called "Unknowing the Truth."<br>
<br>
Ready to start the final mission? Good, make sure you do a quick save or whatever so you can go back to it if you screw up. Next step: Start the mission.<br>
<br>
After the cutscene at the beginning has finished, you should now be sitting in a car holding 2.1 million GTA$. Make sure you get a bit further away from the Epsilon building before executing the mischievous plan you've had all along.<br>
<br>
Roughly 20 meters away? Good. You should place yourself in this formation:<br>

<br>
That's right. Now throw a Sticky Bomb right on his rear. Don't have one? Improvise. Either test your luck... or maybe skill with grenades or try shooting the car... Now you have the money, do what the on screen text tells you. Escape those cops and be gone!<br>
<br>
Once the mission is over, I'm sure you're feeling like that was the biggest waste of your life. But seriously... it kind of was! I'm just kidding, like I said, that 2.1 million can have a huge impact when it comes to the Assassination missions.							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Random Event: Animal Ark Owner													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							In this one, you barely have to do anything. So I'm just going to get straight into it. Oh, and your reward is a simple $100,000. But every little helps, right? Especially if it's as easy as this.<br>
<br>
First, head to this location:<br>
<a href="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/359527056806915337/D67F85317734191187E14516F859900E06FA5B65/" class="modalContentLink" data-modal-content-popup-url="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/displayimageformodaldialog/?imageurl=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.akamai.steamusercontent.com%2Fugc%2F359527056806915337%2FD67F85317734191187E14516F859900E06FA5B65%2F"><img src="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/359527056806915337/D67F85317734191187E14516F859900E06FA5B65/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeFull inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
Once you're here, you should see a random event blip appear on your mini map. If not, it may take a while to load in. Just drive around the block a few times. Once it's spawned in, you should see a kid get his bike (bicycle) stolen. Run the guy who took the bike over and get on the bike. Deliver the bike back to the kid. Mission complete... Seriously... It's THAT easy!<br>
<br>
After you get an email from him saying how rich he is and that he claims to be the owner and founder of Animal Ark, go to the LCN Stock Market. Then go to "My Portfolio" and you should see that you have an investment in Animal Ark worth just over $100,000:<br>

							Tips and Tricks - Earning BEFORE Spending!													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							So to top this finale off, I'd like to mention that I feel it is ultimately necessary to help you through it if you want to get the most possible legit money. So, these are some things that are too small to be in their own sections but are too important to be left out.<br>
<br>
<div class="bb_h1"><b><u> Earn before Assassinations Missions, Spend Later!</u></b></div><br>
This is probably the easiest and biggest way of getting the best possible outcome before you hit your shopping spree. Obviously, throughout the campaign you will NEED guns. So those are an exception (along with ammo of course).<br>
But Gangstar, what about car-<br>
<a href="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/359527056807125190/DCDD38E2086DCDF633446AE24A6D3717214A8025/" class="modalContentLink" data-modal-content-popup-url="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/displayimageformodaldialog/?imageurl=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.akamai.steamusercontent.com%2Fugc%2F359527056807125190%2FDCDD38E2086DCDF633446AE24A6D3717214A8025%2F"><img src="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/359527056807125190/DCDD38E2086DCDF633446AE24A6D3717214A8025/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal floatLeft" alt="" title=""></a><br>
No. No cars. No haircuts. No clothes (because who actually pays $10,000 for a T-Shirt anyway). No "strip club spending sprees." No killing yourself and spending $5,000 on a stupid medical bill. Actually, why on earth does a T-Shirt cost more than the average medical bill? Who cares. Just limit yourself to what you buy.<br>
<br>
<div class="bb_h1"><b><u>Get the best crew in the Story Mode Heists!</u></b></div><br>
Just visit the "How to get the Most Money in Heists" section for this. Someone made a guide especially for this, so I didn't have to do anything other than link his guide to mine.<br>
<br>
<div class="bb_h1"><b><u>Random Events: Gruppe 6 Robbery</u></b></div><br>
You may have seen the odd "Gruppe 6" van being loaded up with a briefcase full of cash or keeping you behind traffic, right? Well time to make them useful. Blow open them doors or shoot the guy with the briefcase. Whatever you do, just don't blow up the vehicle... or get shot to death.<br>
Grab the briefcase and run.<br>
<br>
What this little bit of cash does? Well, cover your costs of the money you spend on ammo.<br>
<br>
<div class="bb_h1"><b><u>Random Events: Stolen Items and Random Shop Robbery</u></b></div><br>
When those random people get their purse/wallet stolen, instead of returning it, be the annoying rich guy you wanted to be and keep the money for yourself. Because nobody's going to call the police now are they?<br>
<br>
Another time, you just walk into a shop or barbers or something like that. Suddenly, it's being robbed. What do you do? Come to the rescue of course. That money doesn't want to be in the hands of someone trying to make a living, it wants to be in the hands of someone who's already made a living! Or... sort of... But that's YOU! Don't return it and don't get the feds on you either.<br>
<br>
<div class="bb_h1"><b><u>Bonus Cash</u></b></div><br>
Well... you pre-ordered this game? You may have a pre-order bonus then. For example, mine's $500,000. Keep that safe.<br>
I'm not sure whether you can deactive the "DLC" bonus cash and reactivate when you've met all characters but if someone can prove this works, I'll happily add it to the guide and credit them.							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Assassination 1: The Hotel Assassination													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							This assassination is the very first mission you will need to do. Sadly, you cannot wait until all of your Story missions are done as you will get a text from Franklin at one point before a heist saying something like 'I need to do something from Lester first before we can make a move on this thing'.  This is when you will have to do it. Here is the statistics for this mission.<br>
<br>
Assassination 1: The Hotel Assassination<br>
Highest Price Seen: $379.85<br>
Lowest Price Seen: $360.14<br>
Stock Market Needed: BAWSAQ<br>
Buying Method.: Before Mission<br>

<br>
These statistics are the MOST IMPORTANT part of the guide.<br>
<br>
I personally didn't do this one the last time (on PC) because I forgot to invest as I'm an idiot. But seriously, this one doesn't really matter too much as I still got $800,000,000 in the end so it didn't make much of an effect. Although, do this anyway as it can help out a lot, especially if you have a Pre - Order bonus.<br>
<br>
Before you do this mission, invest in BettaPharmaceuticals (BET). Make sure you invest ALL of your money into this. A screenshot below should help you. You will want to make ALL THREE Story Mode characters (Micheal De Santa, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Phillips) invest ALL of their hard earned cash. Just before you go ahead with this, make sure you save before you invest and immediately after you complete the mission. Once you have invested, go and do the mission right away.<br>

<br>
Once this has been completed and you have used the Quick Save feature on your phone, head straight home. The best way to pass time while your Stock Market investment increases is Sleeping. It's boring but quick and free. Make sure you make alternative saves incase you over shoot your investment and miss the highest prices. How I do it is save once you get home, go to sleep, check your phone. If it has risen over those six hours your character has been sleeping, quick save, sleep and repeat. Once you notice your percentage or price starts decreasing, reload the save where it was highest and sell all of your shares for all three characters.<br>

<br>
BUT WAIT! Before you do anything, just after you've finished selling your shares and got this cash, you are still not done. Ready for some more cash? Of course you are. Quickly head over to Redwood (RWC) in the LCN Stock Market and do the same process on this. The reason you will earn a lot from this is because the market has just crashed, so the shares go back up quickly.<br>

<b>BUT WAIT!</b><br>
<br>
Here is what one of the readers of this guide, CaptnMorgs, have said "After the Vice Assassination Mission and you sell you stocks in Fruit, you should invest in Facade on the BAWSAQ right away. The stocks of Facade rebound after the Vice Assassination mission. I bought the stocks at about $316 and sold at $418 for around a 32% return."<br>
I have yet to confirm this myself, however this is what Sluigi, another reader of this guide, has said "It is what it is, I invested in Facade after selling my Fruit shares, like Captn said. If those don't pay off I can just reload my save from selling the Fruit and move on."<br>
<u><b>This method actually works! I know this by a screenshot that FakeD posted proving the shares shooting up for Facade on the BAWSAQ stock market. There are no screenshots I can provide however at this time. I will add some shortly</b></u>.

Once you notice your percentage or price starts decreasing, reload the save where it was highest and sell all of your shares for all three characters.<br>

These statistics are the MOST IMPORTANT part of the guide.<br>
<br>
Before you do this mission, invest in GoldCoast (GCD). Make sure you invest ALL of your money into this. A screenshot below should help you. You will want to make ALL THREE Story Mode characters (Micheal De Santa, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Phillips) invest ALL of their hard earned cash. Just before you go ahead with this, make sure you save before you invest and immediately after you complete the mission. Once you have invested, go and do the mission right away.<br>

Once this has been completed and you have used the Quick Save feature on your phone, head straight home. The best way to pass time while your Stock Market investment increases is Sleeping. It's boring but quick and free. Make sure you make alternative saves incase you over shoot your investment and miss the highest prices. How I do it is save once you get home, go to sleep, check your phone. If it has risen over those six hours your character has been sleeping, quick save, sleep and repeat. Once you notice your percentage or price starts decreasing, reload the save where it was highest and sell all of your shares for all three characters.<br>

Congratulations! You have now completed all of the assassination missions. You may now do the random event (if you haven't already).<br>

							Random Event: The Tinkle [TNK] Investment													</div>
						<div class="subSectionDesc">
							If you haven't already, you can now go do the Random event to complete your bank before you go off showing off your cash, buying every property in Los Santos and pimping hundreds of cars and hanging out with your other billionaire buddies.This is the very last mission/event regarding investment changes in the LCN and BAWSAQ Stock Market. Just one step away now.<br>
<br>
BEFORE you go ahead with this mission, please invest before you start it. If you see him, keep a distance from him and switch between characters to invest. This is because as soon as the man gets out of the car the stock shoots up (for some people anyway).<br>
<br>
First off, get in a fast car like the well known Comet. You don't need a super car or sports car, you can just use Franklin's Bravado Buffalo if you want.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427702818&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721587986/C59F38295D1096A9148751A174383A03D78B3AC6/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703933&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721593199/D95DA681E101F3859D01064BCCDF8BF3B4AFC48D/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
Now you have a good car, make sure you have Franklin driving it so you can use his special ability if you mess up.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427830688&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357722030292/BDD26CEBA1727B7770139221C27D8F8F1D445051/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
Now that you are all set and ready for the final journey to becoming the richest man in Los Santos, place a marker and head to the location like I have.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427702636&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721587331/F97364DB695011E4D51F6F5527257E0791559122/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
Once you have got there, you should see a man in a black suit next to a broken down black car. Stop next to him and let him in. Then drive as fast as you can (preferably without crashing at all) using Franklin's special ability in the moment when it's required most to the Los Santos International Airport.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427702940&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721588833/9C20E2D43107FAD8B7F4BAD6B9C5268C1358751A/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
When you have arrived at the location, he should get out the car, telling you to invest in Tinkle (TNK). <br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703043&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721589393/71FE33B8B1A651D4DEC6EFAECE3191249EBE703D/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703148&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721589886/CEB679E3C3928AB4C44702309CF90D4E37866667/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
This can be found on BAWSAQ.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427835357&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357722046828/D69B64CA73EB9ABAA72E168190D95458D0AD5EA4/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427835507&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357722047349/E37C13D4E882BC679748DFBD3350251FC44012F4/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
Now, as fast as you can, get all three characters to invest in this. You could do this before hand I think, although I have never tried it. If you want, let me know if it works.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427704604&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721595717/ACFFD793446D29F39E1FD2C578CB7AAC037F5958/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
If necessary, you may want to go to sleep too.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703352&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721590844/B8EB2B78E2427C70FB6E8ACF3B1866DABA6145BB/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
Don't forget to check your phone when you wake up!<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427703435&insideModal=1" class="modalContentLink" ><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721591171/216C50CDCE593335C49B7BB91E67B127193D06E3/" class="sharedFilePreviewImage sizeOriginal inline" alt="" title=""></a><br>
<br>
The rough percentage is about 30. Once it reaches near that, sell your shares.<br>
<br>
Congratulations! Your bank account is now filled full of cash and you now hopefully have become a billionaire. If not, maybe you got somewhere near what I got? Who cares!? If you have more than $300,000,000 then I shouldn't be worrying! You're all set and ready to flick your dollars everywhere! Strip club? Shoved a million down that s**** throat. Los Santos Customs? Stick dollar bills to your car. Ammunation? Shoot dollars at that d**** face. Police chase? Bribery. Simple. You have now become a bigger d*** than Devin Weston! <br>
<br>
Now go out there into the gigantic map of San Andreas and live a life of Bill Gates. Just a less intelligent and more crazy version of him.							<div style="clear: both"></div>

							Thanks for reading through my guide, I hope I helped you out a lot. <br>
<br>
This suprisingly only took four hours to make. Probably all of that copying and pasting. No I didn't copy and paste off of any sources. I just copied some stuff I put in previous sections in the current section in the making to speed things up.<br>
<br>
I may be adding more sections for beginners and maybe some more screenshots to help or just to make it look good. It would help me out a lot if you see a spelling mistake and report it for me. I made this as quickly as possible so that people can see this before completing the whole Story Mode which may be why there is spelling mistakes (I'm sure there's some). I may also alter some details to this guide at anytime.<br>
<br>
If you need to ask me anything, feel free to put it in the comments. I'm nearly always on Steam anyway so it shouldn't be days waiting for a reply.<br>
<br>
Just before I end it, I want to say a huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to help me make the guide better. It wouldn't be as good without the feedback! Also thank you for posting your scores in the comments! I'm always pleased to hear from you all on how you are doing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope this helped you and have a nice day :)<br>
